                    <h3>Global digital currency</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bitcoin is a type of <em>global digital currency</em> that sends and receives funds across the Internet.</li> <li>Bitcoins' generation and exchange are securely regulated by encryption, based on cryptography.</li>
                        <li>Bitcoins, when used during online transactions, can ensure <em>security</em> and <em>privacy</em>. That means you can transfer Bitcoins to people without anybody knowing your true identity!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>How do you get Bitcoins?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bitcoins can be either <em>purchased online</em> (with real money!) or acquired through <em>"mining."</em></li>
                        <li>Bitcoins are generated through the mining process, which is rather complex - and increasingly difficult (i.e. expensive) by design. While in the past it could be easily done by home computers, now it typically requires <em>dedicated machines</em> with <em>expensive chips</em>.<br>

                                <p><em>Here's the technological details on how it works:</em></p>
                                <p>During the mining process, your machine will generate, through SHA-256 algorithm, lengthy random numbers within a limited range, and thereby secure the block chain transaction (included in the block chain is a secret private key or data "seed" used as mathematical proof of the transaction). Reimbursement for this work is in the form of Bitcoins.</p>
                                <p>In order for a transaction to be confirmed -- to avoid the same Bitcoin from being spent twice, for example -- a number of bitcoin nodes, operated by miners around the world, need to give successfully defined transaction number their seal of approval. People join "pools" to share in the costs required to complete this search for what are essentially random numbers within an allowable range and receive payments in Bitcoins.</p>

                    <h3>What does the future of Bitcoins look like?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bitcoins can be <em>bought and sold</em> with real money, as well as used like real money (there have been increasingly more merchants and online services accept Bitcoins as a form of payment).</li>
                        <li>By design, only 21 million Bitcoins can be mined in total. As of April 2018, <em>17 million</em> have already been mined.</li>
                        <li>It is estimated that the last Bitcoins will not be mined until the <em>22nd century</em>.</li>

                        <p>Bitcoin was designed by a pseudonymous known as Satoshi Nakamoto, to work as a medium of exchange that would work as a decentralized currency using cryptography to control its management. The domain was register is 2008, but only in 2009 it got announced after the project got registered on SourceForge.net, an open source software and its first version is released. The lack of a line interface furthers the speculation that it was developed by more than one person. By the end of 2009, Bitcoin establishes its value of US$1 = 1,309.03BTC and the equation used was the same that included the cost of electricity to run a machine that generated Bitcoins.In 2010 a platform called MtGox was created by Jed McCaleb as a currency exchange market. In the same year a vulnerability that causes Bitcoins to be improperly verified is discovered and 184 billion Bitcoins are generated. In December 2010 the first mobile Bitcoin transaction occurred. In January 2011, Three hundred trillion dollars are traded for 12 BTC. In February 2011, Bitcoin reaches parity with the US dollar for the first time. In June 2011, MtGox suffers a significant breach of security and requires the site to shut down for seven hours. The issue forced MtGox price down to US$17.51 to US$0.01 per Bitcoin.</p>
