                        <p>Bitcoin is a type of global digital currency that sends and receives funds across the internet. It uses encryption (based on cryptography) to regulate the generation of bitcoin units and verify the transfer of these funds. Bitcoins can be used for online transactions and can be transfered between bitcoin wallets without disclosing the true identities of persons involved in the exchange. Included in the block chain wallets is a secret private key or data "seed" used as mathematical proof of the transaction. Bitcoins can be purchased via a web account with a wallet provider, paid via credit card. A growing number of merchants and services accept payment via bitcoin. Bitcoin operates some ATM's where cash can be withdrawn against an account.</p>
                        <p>The process for "mining" bitcoins requires dedicated ASIC or GPU machines with expensive dedicated chips specifically designed to process through the SHA-256 Algorithm to generate lengthy random numbers within a limited range - thus securing the block chain transaction. Reimbursement for this work is in the form of Bitcoins. In order for a transaction to be confirmed — to avoid the same Bitcoin from being spent twice, for example — a number of bitcoin nodes, operated by miners around the world, need to give successfully defined transaction number their seal of approval. Individuals join "pools" to share in the costs required to complete this search for what are essentially random numbers within an allowable range and receive payments in Bitcoins. Only 21 million bitcoins can be mined in total, and effective April 2018 – 17 million had been mined. The search for these transaction validation numbers is increasingly difficult (expensive) and the payment for successfully defining a new block (in the chain) is progressively reduced as more blocks are defined. Based upon the increasing difficulty of the calculations required, the growing number of miners, and the diminishing number of bitcoins available for earning - it is estimated that the final bitcoins may not be earned until the 22nd Century. </p>
