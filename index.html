                        <p>Bitcoin is a type of global digital currency that sends and receives funds across the internet. It uses encryption (based on cryptography) to regulate the generation of bitcoin units and verify the transfer of these funds. Bitcoins can be used for online transactions and can be transfered between bitcoin wallets without disclosing the true identities of persons involved in the exchange. Included in the block chain wallets is a secret private key or data "seed" used as mathematical proof of the transaction. Bitcoins can be purchased via a web account with a wallet provider, paid via credit card. A growing number of merchants and services accept payment via bitcoin. Bitcoin operates some ATM's where cash can be withdrawn against an account.</p>
                        <p>The process for "mining" bitcoins requires dedicated ASIC or GPU machines with expensive dedicated chips specifically designed to process through the SHA-256 Algorithm to generate lengthy random numbers within a limited range - thus securing the block chain transaction. Reimbursement for this work is in the form of Bitcoins. In order for a transaction to be confirmed — to avoid the same Bitcoin from being spent twice, for example — a number of bitcoin nodes, operated by miners around the world, need to give successfully defined transaction number their seal of approval. Individuals join "pools" to share in the costs required to complete this search for what are essentially random numbers within an allowable range and receive payments in Bitcoins. Only 21 million bitcoins can be mined in total, and effective April 2018 – 17 million had been mined. The search for these transaction validation numbers is increasingly difficult (expensive) and the payment for successfully defining a new block (in the chain) is progressively reduced as more blocks are defined. Based upon the increasing difficulty of the calculations required, the growing number of miners, and the diminishing number of bitcoins available for earning - it is estimated that the final bitcoins may not be earned until the 22nd Century. </p>

                        <p>Bitcoin was designed by a pseudonymous known as Satoshi Nakamoto, to work as a medium of exchange that would work as a decentralized currency using cryptography to control its management. The domain was register is 2008, but only in 2009 it got announced after the project got registered on SourceForge.net, an open source software and its first version is released. The lack of a line interface furthers the speculation that it was developed by more than one person. By the end of 2009, Bitcoin establishes its value of US$1 = 1,309.03BTC and the equation used was the same that included the cost of electricity to run a machine that generated Bitcoins.In 2010 a platform called MtGox was created by Jed McCaleb as a currency exchange market. In the same year a vulnerability that causes Bitcoins to be improperly verified is discovered and 184 billion Bitcoins are generated. In December 2010 the first mobile Bitcoin transaction occurred. In January 2011, Three hundred trillion dollars are traded for 12 BTC. In February 2011, Bitcoin reaches parity with the US dollar for the first time. In June 2011, MtGox suffers a significant breach of security and requires the site to shut down for seven hours. The issue forced MtGox price down to US$17.51 to US$0.01 per Bitcoin.</p>
