    <p>The value of a bitcoin is dependent upon three factors: 1.) how it is obtained (earned by mining; paid for via exchange of another currency; or payment for products or services provided); 2.) the over-arching investment goals of this holding (portfolio diversification; inflation hedge; and/or avoidance of government issued currency); and 3.) willingness to take risk – and in the case of bitcoin – the belief in the long-term bitcoin commitment of others in the technology sector. The difference between bitcoin and other investments is that the financial value of this option was specifically designed to offer a “counter-currency” to the traditional government backed options. It is not backed by any gold standard – but instead only by the willingness of investors to first – acquire bitcoin via exchange for some other currency, product or service; and second their inclination to hold onto the currency – thus limiting its availability in the marketplace. The initial phase of the value of bitcoin was driven by steadily increasing investment acceptance/demand. In late 2017 a frenzy of excessive demand created by a variety of factors (aggressive and efficient mining; economic instability in some other market sectors; and political concerns of a rising populism worldwide) drove the value to an unsustainable high (nearly $20 K per coin). Since then the value has dropped down to the resource cost for mining each coin – with some geographic areas advantaged by a cheaper cost for the electricity required for the extensive server processing time. A strict formula imposing a lower payment for each bitcoin mined (dropping the payment by one-half for every 2,000 coins mined) has recently overridden the seemingly diminished investor demand. The impact of two unknowns looming in the future clouds the ability to estimate bitcoin’s future value: one is the negative influence of other electronic currencies that may swamp the market. Another is the question as to what will happen when all of bitcoin’s 21 million allocation is realized and the currency value is driven only by marketplace demand? There is no precedent for firmly projecting an electronic currency valuation into the future – as all other currencies and financial holdings are based on limited physical resources (example: gold, diamonds, agricultural products, etc.). Your personal answers to the three factors posed above (bitcoin acquisition; investment goals; risk acceptance) will help you decide – is bitcoin for you?  </p>
